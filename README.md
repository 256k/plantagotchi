## what is plantagotchi 
this is a norns script that is inspired by the tamagotchi game

### ideas:
- plant growth will be a fractal-esque natural growth algo thing. not just predetermined sections
- plant can react to malnourishment or over nourishment
- script plays ambient music in the background and the melodies get more dissonant the unhealther the plant is
- plant growth rate is based on date and time



## PS
this means i'm gonna have to study some stuff about plant growth, something i never thought i would ever get interested in.
